Zucchetto Volante

*A Flappy Bird-inspired game that is currently in development set in the dramatic world of "Conclave 2024" and His Holiness, Pope Francis*

About the Game
Zucchetto Volante ("Flying Zucchetto") is a fun, challenging arcade game where you take control of a cardinal's zucchetto (skullcap) as it soars through the halls of the Vatican. Dodge obstacles, collect votes, and survive as long as you can in this high-stakes, papal-themed adventure!

Inspired by the political intrigue of Conclave 2024, this game puts you in the shoes—or rather, the hat—of a cardinal maneuvering through the twists and turns of Vatican politics.

If you hit an obstacle, it's Habemus No-Papam—game over!
